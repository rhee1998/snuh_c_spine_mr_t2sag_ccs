# **Predicting Cervical Canal Stenosis (CCS) from T2 Mid-sagittal MRI**
---
## **Overview**

* This repository contains `python` scripts for executing deep learning models that predict **cervical canal stenosis (CCS)** from **mid-sagittal T2-weighted MRI** of the cervical spine.

* For more information, plese refer to our article titled, "Deep learning-based prediction of cervical canal stenosis from mid-sagittal T2-weighted MRI", authored by Wounsuk Rhee MD, Sung Cheol Park MD, Hyoungmin Kim MD PhD (Corresponding author), Bong-Soon Chang MD PhD, and Sam Yeol Chang MD. (Currently under review)
